An Access Point (AP) is the base station, like a wireless router in your house.

A BSS is a wifi network with only one AP and any amount of user devices.

An ESS is when there are multiple APs per wifi network and any amount of user devices. Large buildings needing seamless roaming use this.

A BSSID is the MAC address of the Access Point.

A SSID is a textual name for the BSS.

An ESSID is a textual name but for an ESS. Most user devices will use the term 'SSID' instead.
